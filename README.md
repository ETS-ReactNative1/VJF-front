## What is it?

Vite J'ai Faim is a mobile application I imagined and coded as my graduation project at [La Capsule Academy](https://www.lacapsule.academy/). <br/>
This is the front-end repo. <br/>
See back-end [here](https://github.com/Wawamama/VJF)

## About the project

Vite J'ai Faim is a food delivery mobile application for adventurous food lovers who spend too much time scrolling on Uber Eats or other food app.
The idea is to let the app choose your meal for you, based on your mood and position. Surprise surprise!
